I'm looking for full-time opportunities starting in May 2026!

I'm a final-year PhD student studying computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, advised by [Prof. Stuart Russell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/) and [Prof. Sanjit Seshia](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/). My research is focused on AI safety, particularly in the area of multi-agent learning and LM agents. Recently, Iâ€™ve done work on enabling adversarial learning algorithms in cooperative settings, solving issues of covariate shift in training LM agents on long-horizon tasks, as well as evaluating safety risks posed by LM agents in multi-agent settings. My PhD is currently funded by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (NSF GRFP).

I received my BS in computer science and mathematics from the University of Texas at Austin in 2021, where I worked in the [Autonomous Systems group](https://u-t-autonomous.github.io/) under [Prof. Ufuk Topcu](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/topcu). I also spent time at NASA Ames Research Center in the [Planning and Scheduling Group](https://www.nasa.gov/content/planning-scheduling) with [Dr. Jeremy Frank](https://www.nasa.gov/content/jeremy-frank).

In my free time, I enjoy climbing/bouldering, cycling, hiking, and playing board games.
