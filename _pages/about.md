I am a second-year PhD student studying computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, advised by [Prof. Stuart Russell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/) and [Prof. Sanjit Seshia](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/). I'm interested in human-AI cooperation, multiagent systems, and AI safety. In my research I use tools from machine learning, game theory, and formal methods.

I received my BS in computer science and mathematics from the University of Texas at Austin in 2021, where I worked in the [Autonomous Systems group](https://u-t-autonomous.github.io/) under [Prof. Ufuk Topcu](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/topcu). I also spent time at NASA Ames Research Center in the [Planning and Scheduling Group](https://www.nasa.gov/content/planning-scheduling) with [Dr. Jeremy Frank](https://www.nasa.gov/content/jeremy-frank).

In my free time, I enjoy climbing/bouldering, cycling, hiking, and playing board games.
