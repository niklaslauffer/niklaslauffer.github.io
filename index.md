## About Me

I'm a final-year PhD student studying computer science at the UC Berkeley, advised by [Stuart Russell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/) and [Sanjit Seshia](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sseshia/). My PhD is currently funded by a National Science Foundation and a Cooperative AI Fellowship. I recently interned at [Scale AI](https://scale.com/research) on the Reasoning and Agents team and the Safety, Evaluations, and Alignment Lab (SEAL). I received my BS in computer science and math from UT Austin in 2021, where I worked in the [Autonomous Systems group](https://u-t-autonomous.github.io/) with [Ufuk Topcu](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/topcu). I also spent time at NASA Ames Research Center in the [Planning and Scheduling Group](https://www.nasa.gov/content/planning-scheduling) with [Jeremy Frank](https://www.nasa.gov/people/jeremy-frank/).

My current research is focused on AI safety and reinforcement learning, particularly in the area of multi-agent learning and LM agents. Recently, I've done work on [enabling adversarial learning algorithms in cooperative settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09535), solving issues of [covariate shift in training LM agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14895) on long-horizon tasks, as well as evaluating [safety risks posed by LM agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14143) in multi-agent settings. 


In my free time, I enjoy rock climbing, cycling, hiking, playing board games, and drinking specialty teas (I like ripe [pu'ers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pu%27er_tea), aged whites, and black teas).
